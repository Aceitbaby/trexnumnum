you need to start ur own javascript program that displays it
or u can use this
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en
if u go on it then download it 
after it should be in the google apps 
open it and turn of the server first
then select the files exept for this
